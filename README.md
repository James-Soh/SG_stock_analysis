# SG_stock_analysis

## Introduction for the project 
  
  I want to take advantage in the drop in share prices for many compaines due to COVID-19
  I am planning on investing in some companies on the Singapore Stock Exchange but do not know which to invest into
  Out of 5 stocks I am interested in, I want to find the best stock to invest in and maybe build a model to predict share prices?

## Outline of analysis
  Used pandas datareader to scrape stock data from yahoo
  Used pandas to find out the historical peak share price for each of the 5 stocks and the corresponding date
  Used data visualisations libraries (plotly, seaborn, matplotlib) to make a Candlestick graph and a 30 days moving average line graph of the closing price to.
  Build LSTM model with Keras and TensorFlow to predict stock price.
